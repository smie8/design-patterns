# Design patterns

Someone have already solved your problems. Design patterns are proven general solutions to common design problems.

Most patterns and principles address issues of change in software.

Most patterns allow some part of a system to vary independently of all other parts.

We often try to take what varies in a system and encapsulate it.

All design involves tradeoffs, as does all software design.

Consider these before applying design patterns:
- Abstraction vs speed
- Space vs time


# Design principles

1. Identify the aspects of your application that vary and separate them from what stays the same.
2. Program to an interface, not an implementation.
3. Favor composition over inheritance.
4. Strive for loosely coupled designs between objects that interact.
5. Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification.
6. Depend upon abstractions. Do not depend upon concrete classes.
7. Only talk to your friends.
8. Don't call us, we'll call you.
9. A class should have only one reason to change.
