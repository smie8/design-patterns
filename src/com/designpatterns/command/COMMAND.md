# Command Pattern

Encapsulates a _request as an object_, thereby letting you parameterize clients with different requests, queue or log requests, and support undoable operations.

It helps you turn a request or action into an object, which can be then passed around, stored, and executed at a later time.

Decouples the sender (invoker, action requester) from the receiver (the one performing the action).
