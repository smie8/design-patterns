The Strategy Pattern = defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.

By employing the Strategy Pattern, you're separating the "what" (the algorithm) from the "how" (the implementation details). This promotes clean code, modular design, and maintainability, making your software more adaptable to changes and new requirements.
